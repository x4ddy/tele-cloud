"""Async wrapper over Supabase GoTrue for signup/login/logout (SPEC.md §6.4).

Password handling is **delegated to Supabase** — this module never sees or hashes
a password beyond forwarding it to GoTrue, and never rolls its own credential
store (SPEC §6.4). It is a thin, async adapter: it turns GoTrue's response into a
small, framework-free :class:`AuthSession` (the user id/email plus the issued
tokens) and turns GoTrue's errors into the shared :class:`TeleCloudError`.

It depends only on the Supabase auth client and ``config`` (for the URL + anon
key). It does **not** touch the database or enforce quota — those belong to
``database/`` and ``quota/``. Verification email is sent by **Supabase** itself
(built-in email confirmation), not by the app (SPEC §6.4).
