// Curated icon set — only the icons actually referenced via data-lucide. Importing
// these by name (instead of the whole `lucide` icons object) lets the bundler
// tree-shake the other ~1700 icons out, cutting the bundle by an order of magnitude.
//
// Keys MUST be PascalCase: lucide's createIcons converts a data-lucide name
// (e.g. "folder-plus") to PascalCase ("FolderPlus") and looks it up here.
